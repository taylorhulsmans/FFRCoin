        <p class="text-center headline">Think money doesn't grow on trees? I'm sorry but you have been deceived<br/></p>
        <p class="text-center headline">In the real world, 90-95% of all money is created not by central banks or government, but by commercial banks</p>
        <p class="text-center headline">They do it when someone asks for a loan. While many believe that they go into their vault and fork over the cash, this is false. <br/><br><i>They print it from nothing...</i</p>
        <p class="text-center headline">This process is called fractional reserve banking, and if try this without being a bank you will get convicted of forgery and fraud</p>
        <p class="text-center headline">But Alas, this system of slavery, this pestulence upon the dignity of free men, only survives behind a theatre of complexity, of jargon and doublespeak</p>
        <p class="text-center headline">Fiat Frenzy cuts through the complexity by gamifying FRB so everyone can intuitivly understand how the global monetary system operates</p>
        <p class="text-center headline">For those who choose to venture past this message, take heart<br/><br/>What you will come to learn by playing this game will not only <i><b>Drastically</b></i> change your perception and beliefs about money. . .<br/><br/> But fundementally <i>rock</i> your understanding of how the world actually operates. . .

            <p class="text-center headline"> Education on monetary mechanics is scant and obsurced by loads of jargon. Indeed, a recent <a href="https://www.ccn.com/nearly-1-3-of-americans-believe-this-myth-about-the-us-dollar/">study</a> Indicates that nearly 30% of Americans think the Nixon Shock never happened, and the dollar is still backed by gold</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="text-center headline">It is of critical importance that we take the concept of fractional reserve lending, and reduce it from incomprensible word salad to so easy a 4 year old with daddies crypto can do it</p>

            <br/>
            <p class="text-center headline">Fiat Frenzy builds atop the Ethereum blockchain and standard token contract, and adds the ability to offer, sign and repay loans</p>
            <p class="text-center headline">But when I say sign and repay, I don't mean them in the way you or I would make a loan arrangment.</p>
            <p class="text-center headline">Oh No...</p>
            <p class="text-center headline">Money will be minted for the debtor, and repaid to the buyer after expiration.</p>
            <p class="text-center headline">The extent to which any individual can perform this, is bounded by the reserve limit of phi - 1 (61.8%) to the annum</p>
            <p class="text-center headline">meaning the max lend is higher the further in time you go</p>
            <p class="text-center headline">To kickstart the frenzy, an oracle will mint tokens for those who provide a proof of meme, simply stick your address into a 4chan post, and add OPS post number and your post number, you will be given your digits in tokens</p>

              <br/>
              <p class="text-center headline"> Awesome, welcome to the frenzy, first start by installing
              <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en" target="_blank">metamask</a> into your browser, it a really common way for a user to use Ethereum on their normal browser</p>
              <br/>
              <p class="text-center headline"> Okay cool, i've installed metamask and followed its steps, i even bothered to write down my seed phrase on paper</p>
              <br/>
              <p class="text-center headline"> Nice work, now comes the crux, we need to get you like 5 bucks in etherum, perhaps
              <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/buy-ethereum" target="_blank">Coinbase</a> will do the job for you, but there is many ways</p>
              <p class="text-center headline">That was arduous, but now I have a bit of crypto</p>
              <p class="text-center headline"> Nice job, you've taken a monumental step in breaking the chains of fiat-debt slavery, now, press play (at the top) to begin!</p>
